# jQuery-dataTables-dateRange-demo
This is a demo of how to add date range datepickers to a jQuery dataTables-enhanced table.  

The demo was originally created back in December 2010 and hosted on a personal web server.
It was ported here to GitHub to preserve it for the benefit of any remaining jQuery users or jQuery
plugin historians.
